<h1>Re. Albert Momo University Application</h1>
<hr>

<br>Dear Mr. Momo,
<p>Thank you for your reccent application to join Starz University's Science Faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<h2>Starting dates</h2>

<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

   <p>First Semester: 9 October 2022<br>
   Second Semester: 15 January 2023<br>
   Third Semester: 2 May 2023</p>


<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you prefer</p>

<p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website</p>

<h2>Subjects Of study</h2>
<p>At the starz University, we have a pretty open-minded research facility-as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
  You seem like an intelligent,
  dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

<p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>13</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,)<br>
   Measuring the effects on performance of funk bassplayer at temperature exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F),<br>
   when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores</p>

<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks</p>

<h2>Exotic dances moves</h2>

<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, My favourite dances are as follows, with definitions.</P>

<p>
  <dl><dt>Polynesian chicken</dt><dd>dance A little know but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a small village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd></dl></p>

<p>
<dl><dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
<dd>Before the Icelanders developed fired as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved hudding close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffing their bodies around in amperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd></dl></p>

<p>
<dl><dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized br <q>robotic</q>, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd></dl></p>

   <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
