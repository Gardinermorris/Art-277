<p>We've heard it all since the pandemic started-lemon juice can kill the coronavirus, masks don't work, if you already had <a href=""><span style="color:yellow;">COVID-19</span></a>you can't get it again or that the vaccines approved for emergency use will change your DNA or put tracking devices in your body</p>

<p>It's almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out of all of the misinformation. But despite all th myths and urban legends, about half of the U.S population is fully vaccinated. </p>

<p>Wonderful news, right? Wonderful news, right?</p>

<p>Well, not to same. Vaccinated people are up against new set of myths - they're literally magnetic or they're going to shed vaccine components and after the DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite th extra layer of protection, they still have to grapple with the same pandemic realities as everyone else</p>


<p>So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread COVID-19 to others? Infectious disease specialist <a href=""><span style="color:yellow;">Lyssette Cardona</span></a>, MD, answers those questions  and covers why vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the fight against COVID-19.<br><br>

isn't the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there's still a chance that you could become infected.<br><br>
